I'm Peter W(allace) Setter. 

Professionally, I work for a logistics company doing everything from reporting and analysis to database design to backend engineering. (I use SQl in different ways and with different languages/platforms.) 

Outside of work, I enjoy the outdoors and the life I'm building with my wife.  

My avatar was a doodle by a student I found in my classroom during my second year of teaching.
