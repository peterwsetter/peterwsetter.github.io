Peter W Setter Dot Com is the (becoming less) embarassing website of Peter Wallace Setter. The site focuses on my work as a data doer with the occasional post on my hobbies and interests. 

The theme of this website is based on [Solarized Light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).

My avatar is a doodle by an anonymous student left in my classroom during my time as a high school teacher.
