Self-titled website of Peter Wallace Setter. The site focuses on my work as a data doer with the occasional post on my hobbies and interests. 

The theme of this website is based on [Solarized Light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/). Content is written in markdown and converted to html using [python-markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

My avatar is a doodle by an anonymous student left in my classroom during my time as a high school teacher.
